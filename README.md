The objective of this project is to build a web scraper that extracts product information such as(price, reviews, product information, product description, seller's detail etc) from Amazon's website. The scraped data will be used for various purposes, such as price comparison, market analysis, or building a product recommendation system.
With the help of python and its libraries such as (pandas, numpy, request and beautiful soup), we could easily extract data from amazon website and do transformation using pandas and numpy and convert it into csv or json file or anyother format.
